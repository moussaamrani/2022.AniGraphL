\subsection{Linking AUs and TUs}
\label{sec:AUTU}

We already assumed that AUs are ``mapped'' to specific TUs of the MT defining
a \DSL's execution semantics. Depending on the underlying MTL, this mapping may
be given in two ways: by annotating the TUs with the information (typically,
an AU name that allows to retrieve an associated MA specification); conversely,
by annotating the AUs with the TUs they refer to; or using an explicit map
defined outside both the MT and MA specifications. The first approach has already
been successfully used for mapping TUs with debugging steps in \cite{bousse2018omniscient}.

Relating AUs with TUs provides a simple advantage: since the MT already captures
the internal logic and scheduling between TUs, no need to reproduce them for the
AUs. However, this imposes that the execution engine is instrumented for enabling
simple communication with the MA engine. As a first starting step, adopting the 
generic interface for debugging proposed by \citet{bousse2018omniscient} provides
what is necessary: it indicates the MA engine that a simulation has started and
stopped, and that a TU has started (together with appropriate parameters) and 
stopped.
