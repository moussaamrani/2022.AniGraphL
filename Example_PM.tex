\subsection{\textsf{PacMan}: A \DSL for the PacMan game}\label{sec:Examples:PacMan}The PacMan game is a popular arcade game that gained interest in the \MDE communitybecause it captures a well-known, simple reactive \DSL with an easily understandableconcrete syntax, and presents interesting real-time features for execution. \subsubsection{Specification}\label{sec:Examples:PacMan:Specification}On the top left compartment is represented a metamodel$\mathsf{MM}_{\mathsf{PM}}$, as created by a DSL engineer. A \textsf{Game} consists of a sequence of \textsf{Level}s, each displaying a \textsf{Maze} where\textsf{Persona}s evolve. A \textsf{Level} terminates when \textsf{PacMan} is eatenby a \textsf{Ghost}, or when it has eaten all \textsf{Cookie}s. Several playersmay compete for the highest \textsf{Score}.On the top right compartment, a basic model $\mathsf{M}_{\mathsf{2x2}}$ with a\textsf{unique} \textsf{Level} of size 2x2, as possibly created by a modeller,is depicted using three different concrete syntaxes:textual for $^{\mathsf{TXT}}\mathsf{M}_{\mathsf{2x2}}$ (inspired by eMotions \cite{J:RiveraDuranVallecillo:2009}); based on UML Object Diagram for\cite{B:Rumbaugh-Jacobson-Booch:2004} for $^{\mathsf{OD}}\mathsf{M}_{\mathsf{2x2}}$;and freely inspired by the real game for $^{\mathsf{Viz}}\mathsf{M}_{\mathsf{2x2}}$,the two latters being graphical.\begin{figure*}[t]   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,clip, trim=0cm 5.5cm 0cm 0cm]{MM-M-T.pdf}   \caption{Specification of a \DSL for the PacMan game.%   The \DSL Engineer creates the metamodel $\mathsf{MM}_{\mathsf{PM}}$ (following   the Executable \DSML Pattern \citep{Combemale-Cregut-Pantel:2012}); an MT    designer specifies a transformation $\mathsf{TS}_{\mathsf{PM}}$ (composed of   several transformation units such as \emph{\textsf{moveR}} depicted here).}   \label{fig:PacMan}   \Description[<short description>]{<long description>}\end{figure*}\subsubsection{Execution}\label{sec:Examples:PacMan:Execution}The bottom compartment of \autoref{fig:PacMan} describes a simple rule \emph{\textsf{moveR}} (moving Pac-Man on a \textsf{Cell} at its right, if available) as part of the simulation MT specification $\mathsf{TS}_{\mathsf{PM}}$,as part of $\mathsf{MM}_{\mathsf{PM}}$'s executable semantics. The first MT, $\mathsf{TS}_{\mathsf{Xtend}}$, uses metaprogramming (based on Xtend with GeMoC \cite{Leroy-Bousse-etAl:2017}). The next and last onesare based on Graph Transformations: $\mathsf{TS}_{\mathsf{GBT}}$ relies on $^{\mathsf{OD}}\mathsf{M}_{\mathsf{2x2}}$ to express the rewriting (as would be expressed e.g. in Henshin \cite{Bill-Gabmeyer-Kaufmann-Seidl:2014}); while $\mathsf{TS}_{\mathsf{VIZ}}$ relies on $^{\mathsf{Viz}}\mathsf{M}_{\mathsf{2x2}}$(as would be expressed e.g. in AtoMPM \cite{J:SyrianiVangheluwe:2013}). Finally, $\mathsf{TS}_{\mathsf{FSM}}$ presents an MT fragment expressed with a UML's Finite State Machine \cite{B:Rumbaugh-Jacobson-Booch:2004}. Note that all MT specifications (fragments) but $\mathsf{TS}_{\mathsf{Xtend}}$ present a graphical representation, showing that MT specifications may well be graphically visualised as well.\subsubsection{Animations}\label{sec:Examples:PacMan:Animations}The PacMan game typically uses three kinds of animations for different situations:\begin{description}   \item[A \textsf{Persona} moves.] Typically, a specific animation could be attached   to each movement, as they are traditionally encoded in different rules/operations   (cf. e.g. \textsl{moveR} as specified in \autoref{fig:PacMan}, but also    \textsl{moveL}, \textsl{moveU} and \textsl{moveD} for moving left, up and down).   Depending on whether the MTL allows using abstract classes (which would be    \textsf{Persona} here) for MT specification, these rules/operations may need    to be duplicated.       \item[\textsf{PacMan} eats a \textsf{Cookie}.] This occurs when \textsf{PacMan} is on a \textsf{Cell}   that contains a \textsf{Cookie}, making it disappear and triggering a    \textsf{Score} update.      \item[\textsf{PacMan} is eaten by a \textsf{Ghost}.] This occurs when    \textsf{PacMan} is on the same \textsf{Cell} as a \textsf{Ghost}, which may occur   by either \textsf{Persona} making a move to an already occupied \textsf{Cell}.\end{description}To summarise, we would have to define four different animations to fully animatethe \textsf{PacMan} \DSL:\begin{description}   \item[PM.1] A \textsf{Persona} disappears from one \textsf{Cell} and reappears   on another (adjacent) \textsf{Cell}.      \item[PM.2] Assuming \textsf{PacMan} is on a \textsf{Cell} containing a \textsf{Cookie},   the \textsf{Cookie} disappears.      \item[PM.3] The \textsf{Score} is updated by a predefined increment.    \item[PM.4] Assuming \textsf{PacMan} and a \textsf{Ghost} are on the same   \textsf{Cell}, \textsf{PacMan} disappears.\end{description}Note that those animations are not completely unrelated. First, \textbf{PM.2} and\textbf{PM.3} need to be conducted sequentially quickly enough to not notice atime gap. Second, \textbf{PM.2} and \textbf{PM.4} appear to be very similar innature: they both assume that two objects are located on the same \textsf{Cell} before making one of them disappear.
