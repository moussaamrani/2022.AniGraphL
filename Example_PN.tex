\subsection{\textsf{PN}: A \DSL for (Simple) Petri Nets}\label{sec:Examples:PN}The formalism of Petri Nets (PNs) is popular for modelling various physical as well ascomputer systems that include concurrency, as it allows formal verification of interesting properties (typically, reachability, safety and liveness)\cite{B:He-Murata:2005}. We consider here simple Place/Transition PNs with weightedarcs with their traditional firing semantics. \subsubsection{Specification}\label{sec:Examples:PN:Specification}\autoref{fig:PN} specifies the metamodel of a PN \DSL. A \textsf{PN} is a bipartitegraph whose nodes are \textsf{Place}s and \textsf{Transition}s, and whose edges arecalled \emph{weighted} \textsf{Arc}s. The \textsf{marking} represents tokens hostedby a \textsf{Place}; it will change during execution along \textsf{Transition} firing. We assume the traditional visual concrete syntax of PNs: a \textsf{Place} is represented as a circle, a \textsf{Transition} as a black thin box, and an \textsf{Arc} as a directed arrow carrying a label representing its \textsf{weight}(omitted when equals to 1).\begin{figure}%   %\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{FSM}%   \caption{A metamodel for Place/Transition Petri Nets.}%   \label{fig:FSM_MM}%\end{figure}\subsubsection{Execution}\label{sec:Examples:PN:Execution}Starting with an initial marking, i.e. setting the values of \textsf{marking} foreach \textsf{Place} appearing in a model, executing a \textsf{PN} consists in sequentially \emph{firing} enabled \textsf{Transition}s, until no \textsf{Transition}s are enabled any more. A \textsf{Transition} \textsf{t} is \emph{enabled} iff each input \textsf{Place} (i.e. a \textsf{Place} connected to\textsf{t} by an \textsf{Arc} directed to \textsf{t}) is marked with at least theweight of the \textsf{Arc}. Firing \textsf{t} consumes tokens from all input \textsf{Place}s and creates tokens on output \textsf{Place}s, according to thecorresponding \textsf{Arc}s' \textsf{weight}. Not that an enabled \textsf{Transition}may not fire, denoting concurrency and non-determinism.\subsubsection{Animations}\label{sec:Examples:PN:Animations}Typically, the execution semantics is implemented with a transformation unit \textsf{step} that would select one enabled \textsf{Transition} among all possible,and \textsf{fire} it. The execution stops when no \textsf{Transition}s are enabledany more. There is several possibilities for animation.\begin{description}
   \item[PN.1] Highlight all \textsf{Transition}s that are enabled;   \item[PN.2] Highlight \emph{the} \textsf{Transition}, among all enabled ones,   that has been selected for firing;   \item[PN.3] Firing a \textsf{Transition}, which may be realised using    different animations:   \begin{description}
      \item[PN.3.1] Removing, at once, all markings from input \textsf{Place}s       and creating new, additional markings on the output \textsf{Place}s.      \item[PN.3.2] Removing/Creating the markings, but sequentially on all input      \textsf{Place}s.      \item[PN.3.2] Removing/Creating the markings as before, but ``sliding'' the      tokens along the \textsf{Arc}s to visually represent the marking transfer.
   \end{description}
\end{description}Again, all those three animations are related in complex ways: it may be possibleto perform them step by step, or automatically, or even interactively leave the choice to the user to select which \textsf{Transition} has to be fired.
