\section{DSL Examples}
\label{sec:Examples}

This Section presents three simple \DSMLs, namely \textsf{PacMan}, Finite State
Machines (\textsf{FSM}), and Petri Nets (\textsf{PN}), following the same 
presentation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The \DSL's structure is specified using a metamodel expressed in \MOF;
   we also informally specify a possible \emph{concrete syntax}, then provide a 
   simple witness model.

   \item The \DSL's semantics is sketched, without details of implementations that
   highly depend on the MTL, and the modelling style of the MT designer. We however
   show for the \textsf{PacMan} example how a similar approach in various MTLs 
   may lead to a similar MT structure, independently of the underlying MTL.

   \item A set of animations are then described in detail, and numbered for 
   future reference.
\end{itemize}
Note that we assume that the \DSL structure follows the Executable \DSML Pattern
\citep{Combemale-Cregut-Pantel:2012}, which consists of two separate metamodels for
defining executable \DSMLs:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The so-called \emph{Domain Definition} metamodel captures the 
   \emph{static} structure of the \DSL, which typically serves for defining valid
   models using various textual and/or visual syntaxes;
   
   \item The \emph{State Definition} metamodel adds new information on top of the
   Domain Definition metamodel to enable state-based execution, thus defining those
   elements that are modified during execution.
\end{itemize}
Both metamodels typically need to be merged, using different techniques (e.g.,
using \MOF's ``package merge'' approach \cite{TR:OMG-MOF:2016}, or other 
composition techniques \cite{J:Abouzahra-Sabraoui-Afdel:2020}).
For clarity and presentation simplification purposes, we depicts both metamodels
in a merged fashion, although we visually distinguish each part: the Domain Definition
metamodel elements are represented using the regular font with plain arrows for 
references; while the State Definition elements use curvy fonts and dotted references.
