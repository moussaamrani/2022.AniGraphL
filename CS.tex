\section{Concrete Syntax}
\label{sec:CS}
A Concrete Syntax (CS) is related to a metamodel \textsf{MM} (or a \DSML) with 
two transformations:

$$ \mathsf{MM} \xrightleftharpoons[\mathrm{parsing}\phantom{MM}]{\phantom{MM}\mathrm{rendering}} \mathsf{CS}$$

The \emph{parsing} relation consists of creating a data structure, an 
\textsf{MM}-conforming model, from basic components. Although this transformation
is difficult when dealing with graphical CS, it may be alleviated
